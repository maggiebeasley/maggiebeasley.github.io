        <p>I love my chicken m0m so much. I love and respect my mum so much that, even though I'm not British, I only speak to her in a British accent. Some say chickens don't make good moms. Well, to those people I say... "Have you met my mom?" </p>


        <ul>
            <li>Have you ever laid your head on a down pillow? Then you've basically used my mom as a pillow.</li>
            <li>Have you ever struggled to fly? Wow, my mom can relate...</li>
            <li>Have you ever wanted to meet a dinosaur? I know a lady.</li>
            <li>Is this thing on?</li>
        </ul>
