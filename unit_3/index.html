            <img src="" title="Chicken Called Mom">

        <p>I love my chicken mm so much. I love and respect my mum so much that, even though I'm not British, I only speak to my mum in a British accent (and call her MUM) because she is my QUEEN. Some say chickens don't make good mums. Well, to those people I say... "Have you met my mum?" </p>


        <ul>
            <li>Have you ever laid your head on a down pillow? Then you've basically used my mum as a pillow.</li>
            <li>Have you ever struggled to fly? Wow, my mum can relate...</li>
            <li>Have you ever wanted to meet a dinosaur? I know a lady.</li>
        </ul>
