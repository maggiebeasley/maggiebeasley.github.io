               <h1>Chicken Called Mom Tumblr</h1> 
                <p>My mom is a chicken and I've survived a flesh eating virus.</p>

                <p>I love my chicken m0m so much. I respect my mum so much that, even though I'm not British, I only speak to her in a British accent. I worship my mom so much that sometimes I bleep out her name, m#m, because it's too sacred to say or spell. Some say chickens don't make good moms. Well, to those people I say... "Have you met my mom?" </p>
            
                <ul>
                    <li>Have you ever laid your head on a down pillow? Then you've basically used my mom as a pillow.</li>
                    <li>Have you ever wanted to use your hands for a greater purpose? Try using them as chicken feeders.</li>
                    <li>Have you ever struggled to fly? Wow, my mom can relate...</li>
                    <li>Have you ever wanted to meet a dinosaur? I know a mom.</li>
                    <li>IS THIS EVEN WORKING!!!!??!?!????</li>
