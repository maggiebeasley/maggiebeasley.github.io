        <p>I love my chicken mom so much. Really want to get out there and spread the word. Some say chickens don't make good moms. Well, to those people I say... "Have you met my mom?" </p>


        <ul>
            <li>Have you ever laid your head on a down pillow? Then you've basically used my mom as a pillow.</li>
            <li>Have you ever struggled to fly? Wow, my mom can relate...</li>
            <li>Have you ever wanted to meet a dinosaur? I know a lady.</li>
        </ul>
